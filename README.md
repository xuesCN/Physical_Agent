# Physical Agent

[Chinese version](README.zh-CN.md)

Physical Agent is a safe runtime for physical-world agents with a SQLite active state backend and Markdown audit / migration compatibility.

For the current GitHub Actions and testing policy, see [`docs/CI.zh-CN.md`](docs/CI.zh-CN.md).

The core idea is deliberately small:

```text
Terminal 1: physical-agent watch
Terminal 2: physical-agent run --task "..."
Workspace: SQLite state.db is the blackboard between cognition and execution.
```

The v1 principle is:

```text
Agent can propose actions. Watch decides whether and how they touch the physical world.
```

## Architecture

Physical Agent separates cognition from physical execution with a two-process runtime.

```text
physical-agent watch
  owns hardware or simulator
  owns driver lifecycle
  owns observation loop
  owns safety enforcement
  owns action execution

workspace/state.db
  SQLite blackboard for task, capabilities, world, actions, feedback, chat, plan, memory, and log

workspace/SAFETY.md
  human-owned safety rule source read before execution

physical-agent run
  reads task, capabilities, world, and feedback
  writes structured action intent
```

`physical-agent run` never imports hardware drivers or SDKs. It only sees StateStore documents. `physical-agent watch` is the only runtime that loads drivers and calls `driver.execute(action)`.

## Quick Start

This section is written for a first-time user. The default quickstart uses the built-in `mock_arm` simulator, so you do not need real hardware or an LLM API key.

### Step 0: Check What You Need

You need:

- Python 3.11 or newer
- a terminal
- this repository

Enter the repository root:

```bash
cd Physical_Agent
```

If you are already in the repository root, you can skip that. The root should contain `pyproject.toml`, `physical_agent/`, `examples/`, and this README.

### Step 1: Install and Initialize

For a fresh clone, run the bootstrap script:

```bash
python scripts/bootstrap.py
```

This command will:

- create a local `.venv`
- install the project with development dependencies
- run the test suite
- create the default `physical-agent.yaml`
- initialize `workspace/`
- run a smoke test that verifies the mock arm can place `red_block` on `tray`

If you already manage your own Python environment, you can run the manual path:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev,server]
physical-agent setup --smoke-test
```

You are ready when you see output like:

```text
Physical Agent project is ready.
Config: .../physical-agent.yaml
Workspace: .../workspace
Smoke test passed: executed 2 action(s), red_block location is tray.
```

### Step 2: Run the GUI First

The GUI is the easiest way to see the workspace state change:

```bash
physical-agent gui
```

The command starts the official FastAPI + React Dashboard and an embedded watch
service. In the Dashboard you can:

1. safely initialize a missing config/workspace without overwriting an existing config
2. see whether the executor is waiting, embedded, external, or not running
3. chat or submit a task, review its draft, and add it to the pending Action Board
4. approve or reject execution and inspect robots, world, feedback, safety, and events
5. scaffold or generate a driver draft and register its robot configuration

The browser no longer owns watch start/stop/step controls. Use
`physical-agent watch` for a standalone executor, `physical-agent api --watch`
for an API-hosted executor, or `physical-agent gui --no-watch` for a Dashboard
process without an embedded executor. The deterministic demo is
`physical-agent setup --smoke-test`.

If the browser does not open automatically, visit:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

The main idea to watch for:

```text
capabilities tells the agent what the robot can do.
actions is the action queue proposed by the agent.
feedback records what watch executed.
world stores the latest observed world state.
```

### Step 3: Run the Two-Terminal CLI Flow

After the GUI path works, the CLI flow is easier to understand. Physical Agent's core runtime uses two terminals:

```text
Terminal 1: physical-agent watch
Terminal 2: physical-agent run --task "..."
```

In the first terminal, start the physical-side watch process:

```bash
physical-agent watch
```

Keep this terminal running. It loads drivers, publishes capabilities, watches actions, and executes them.

In a second terminal, submit a task:

```bash
physical-agent run --task "pick the red block and place it on the tray"
```

If watch is running, you should see a completed task and feedback similar to:

```text
Task completed.
Actions:
- act_001: arm_1.pick object_id: red_block
- act_002: arm_1.place target: tray
Feedback:
- act_001: completed - Picked red_block.
- act_002: completed - Placed red_block on tray.
```

### Step 4: Inspect the Workspace

After running a task, inspect the current state:

```bash
physical-agent inspect
```

You should see the connected mock robot, no pending actions, completed actions, and latest feedback.

You can also inspect the workspace audit and safety files:

```text
workspace/
  SAFETY.md
  LOG.md
  audit/
```

Runtime state lives in `workspace/state.db`. `SAFETY.md` remains the file source for safety rules, `LOG.md` is a human-readable mirror, and `export-audit` creates read-only JSON views under `workspace/audit/`.

### Step 5: Run Health Checks

If something does not work, start with:

```bash
physical-agent doctor
```

Common cases:

- `No capabilities are available yet`: `physical-agent watch` has not started or did not publish capabilities.
- `No feedback arrived before the timeout`: the agent wrote actions, but watch is not running to execute them.
- `Workspace is not initialized`: run `physical-agent setup` or use setup in the GUI.
- To start over: run `physical-agent setup --force --smoke-test`.

### Step 6: Understand the Default Demo

The default `physical-agent.yaml` configures one mock arm:

```yaml
robots:
  arm_1:
    driver: mock_arm
    execution_mode: simulation
    config:
      objects:
        red_block:
          type: block
          color: red
          location: table
        tray:
          type: tray
          location: table
```

So this task:

```text
pick the red block and place it on the tray
```

is turned by the local rule-based planner into two actions:

```text
arm_1.pick(object_id=red_block)
arm_1.place(target=tray)
```

watch validates both actions and then calls the `mock_arm` driver. No real robot is involved.

### Step 7: Where to Go Next

After quickstart works:

1. To understand communication, inspect `workspace/state.db` via `physical-agent inspect` or `physical-agent export-audit`.
2. To understand hardware onboarding, read the "Driver Contract" section.
3. To see a Xiaozhi MCP bridge example, read `docs/xiaozhi-driver-tutorial.zh-CN.md`.
4. To start from an SDK or GitHub repo, run `physical-agent integrate ./vendor_sdk`.

## Local GUI

`physical-agent gui` is a thin launcher for the same FastAPI application and
packaged React Dashboard used by `physical-agent api`. Install the server extra
when working from source:

```bash
pip install -e .[server]
```

By default the launcher runs the embedded watch service. It does not implement
a second controller or a second set of HTTP endpoints.

The console provides:

- safe first-time project initialization
- workspace reset
- actual executor status (waiting, embedded, external, or stopped)
- configured hardware/simulation execution mode
- multi-turn chat
- English and Chinese UI switching
- hardware integration scaffold and LLM driver draft generation
- task submission
- draft-to-pending and execution approval/rejection
- upload, memory search, audit export, state-check, and LLM settings
- robot, world, action board, and feedback views

Watch lifecycle controls, manual stepping, the hard-coded demo, per-message
planner selection, browser code-skill output, and the raw browser doctor are
intentionally not duplicated in the Dashboard. Use, respectively,
`physical-agent watch` / `physical-agent api --watch`,
`physical-agent setup --smoke-test`, `physical-agent chat --planner ...`,
`physical-agent chat --show-code-result`, and `physical-agent doctor`.

The GUI remembers your language choice in the browser. Use the `English` / `中文` buttons in the top bar to switch modes.

By default it binds to `127.0.0.1:8765`:

```bash
physical-agent gui --port 8765
```

Run without opening a browser automatically:

```bash
physical-agent gui --no-open
```

Run the Dashboard without an embedded executor (for example when a standalone
`physical-agent watch` already owns the workspace lease):

```bash
physical-agent gui --no-watch
```

The Hardware integration panel accepts a local SDK path, a GitHub repository URL, or an importable Python package name. Choose `Scaffold` for a deterministic watch-side driver template, or `LLM draft` to let the configured OpenAI-compatible model read SDK context and update `driver.py`. Both modes keep hardware execution outside the browser; the LLM draft is validated in mock mode before it is written back.

## StateStore And Workspace Protocol

The workspace is dynamic protocol state. Runtime state lives in SQLite:

```text
workspace/
  state.db
  SAFETY.md
  LOG.md
  artifacts/
  uploads/
  audit/
```

`state.db` stores task, capabilities, world, actions, feedback, chat, plan, memory, uploads, retrieval chunks, and log entries. Payloads are JSON inside SQLite tables.

`SAFETY.md` is owned by humans and enforced by watch. The agent can read it but cannot bypass it.

`LOG.md` is a human-readable mirror for review; SQLite log entries are the runtime source of truth.

`export-audit` creates a read-only audit view under `workspace/audit/`. It is not a second backend.

The current executable no longer contains the retired Markdown workspace
migrator or full-workspace parser. An old workspace is rejected fail-closed so
that SQLite is never created beside an ambiguous legacy source. If rescue is
required, use an independent worktree at historical commit
`9072b4e9fb600e505668aeb6076eb6cb85e5ff82` to run that checkout's migrator,
then return to the current version and run `physical-agent init` without
`--force`, followed by `physical-agent state-check`. See
[`docs/state-backends.zh-CN.md`](docs/state-backends.zh-CN.md) for the guarded
procedure.

Static configuration belongs in `physical-agent.yaml`. Dynamic state belongs in `workspace/state.db`.

## Driver Contract

Two files are enough to connect a robot:

```text
my_robot_driver/
  physical_driver.yaml
  driver.py
```

`physical_driver.yaml` declares the adapter: name, version, entrypoint, robot kind, configuration schema, dependencies, and capability contract.

`driver.py` implements the adapter by subclassing `PhysicalDriver`. The driver turns structured `Action` objects into hardware or simulator calls, and turns device state into `Observation` objects.

Important boundaries:

- The driver only talks to `physical-agent watch`.
- The driver does not parse Markdown.
- The driver does not call the agent runtime.
- The agent only sees capabilities, world state, actions, and feedback through StateStore.

Create a new local driver scaffold:

```bash
physical-agent driver new my_arm_driver
```

If a hardware project already has a GitHub repo, local SDK checkout, or mature Python package, let Physical Agent create the first integration draft. By default, `integrate` is deterministic scaffold mode:

```bash
physical-agent integrate ./vendor_sdk --name my_device_driver
physical-agent integrate https://github.com/org/device-sdk --name my_device_driver
physical-agent chat --message "帮我接入 ./vendor_sdk"
```

It scans docs and project metadata, infers a transport such as serial, HTTP, WebSocket, MQTT, gRPC, MCP, or SDK, and writes `physical_driver.yaml`, `driver.py`, `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, and `integration-report.md` under `physical-agent-integration/<driver-name>/`.

To let an OpenAI-compatible model draft the real watch-side driver code from SDK context, enable LLM coding:

```bash
physical-agent integrate ./vendor_sdk --name my_device_driver --llm
physical-agent integrate ./vendor_sdk --name my_device_driver --llm --model gpt-5.4
physical-agent chat --planner llm --message "帮我接入这个 SDK ./vendor_sdk"
physical-agent chat --message "帮我接入 ./vendor_sdk --llm"
```

LLM driver coding uses the same `.env` settings as chat and planning. It first creates the safe scaffold, then sends SDK snippets plus the scaffold to the model, accepts only a small allowlist of generated files, performs static manifest/Python/interface validation, and writes `llm-coding-report.md`. Request-side validation never imports, connects, or executes generated driver code; dynamic conformance belongs in an explicit watch-side workflow. If the API fails or the draft does not validate, the safe scaffold remains in place.

The generated driver stays in mock mode first. When LLM coding is enabled, Physical Agent can draft the SDK calls, but the runtime boundary stays the same: the generated driver is loaded only by watch, and actions still go through StateStore, safety validation, and `driver.execute(action)`. The LLM does not execute hardware.

For a hardware onboarding example based on a Xiaozhi MCP bridge, see:

```text
examples/xiaozhi_mcp_hardware/
```

Use it from `physical-agent.yaml`:

```yaml
robots:
  arm_1:
    driver: ./my_arm_driver
    execution_mode: hardware
    config: {}
```

`execution_mode` describes the current robot instance, not what the driver could support. It defaults to `hardware` for fail-safe compatibility; simulated instances must opt in to `simulation` explicitly.

The example shows a safe path from `mode: mock` to `mode: http`, with a `.env.example` file for `XIAOZHI_MCP_ENDPOINT` and optional `XIAOZHI_MCP_TOKEN`.

## Built-In Drivers

`mock_arm` supports:

- `observe`
- `move_to`
- `pick`
- `place`

It maintains a simulated pose, held object, and object map. The default quickstart includes `red_block` and `tray`.

`mock_rover` supports:

- `observe`
- `move_to`

It demonstrates that the driver protocol is not arm-specific.

For a Xiaozhi MCP-style hardware bridge example, start with:

```text
examples/xiaozhi_mcp_hardware/README.md
```

## Safety Gate

Watch validates every action before execution:

- robot exists
- capability exists
- params satisfy the capability JSON schema
- capability constraints are satisfied
- workspace safety rules allow execution
- human approval requirements are respected
- action IDs are not duplicated
- dependencies are already completed

If validation fails, watch does not call the driver. It writes clear feedback, logs the rejection, and removes the action from pending.

## Rule-Based Planner

The first planner is intentionally local and deterministic:

- `observe`, `look`, or `scan` produces `observe`
- `move` or `go` produces `move_to`
- `pick` or `grasp` produces `pick`
- `place` or `drop` produces `place`

For example:

```text
pick the red block and place it on the tray
```

produces a `pick` action followed by a dependent `place` action.

## OpenAI-Compatible API Planner

Physical Agent can use an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint for planning while keeping the same safety boundary: the LLM only writes proposed actions to StateStore; watch still validates and executes them.

Create a local `.env` file. It is ignored by git.

```bash
GPT_URL=https://your-provider.example/v1
GPT_KEY=your_api_key
GPT_MODEL=gpt-5.4
```

Supported variable names:

- API key: `GPT_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Base URL: `GPT_URL` or `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
- Model: `GPT_MODEL` or `OPENAI_MODEL`

LLM calls default to reasoning / deep-thinking when the provider supports it. OpenAI Responses API uses the official `reasoning` parameter; Chat Completions-compatible providers receive provider-specific thinking options only when `GPT_REASONING_EXTRA_BODY` / `OPENAI_REASONING_EXTRA_BODY` is configured, with automatic compatibility fallback when unsupported.

Test the API connection:

```bash
physical-agent llm-test
```

Test a specific model before changing your project defaults:

```bash
physical-agent llm-test --model gpt-5.4
physical-agent chat --planner llm --model gpt-5.4 --message "Say hello in one sentence."
```

If a model test fails but another model works, keep `GPT_MODEL` on the working model. OpenAI-compatible providers do not always expose every model name, even when their HTTP shape is compatible.

Use the LLM planner:

```bash
physical-agent setup --force
physical-agent run --planner llm --task "pick the red block and place it on the tray" --no-wait
physical-agent inspect
```

Use the full chat agent:

```bash
physical-agent setup --force
physical-agent chat
```

`physical-agent chat` is the single everyday entrypoint: start it once, then type normally. It can answer, remember notes, propose physical actions, and route code requests into skills that edit files and run tests.

Or send one message and exit:

```bash
physical-agent chat --message "What can you see right now?"
physical-agent chat "write a tiny square example under test and run it"
physical-agent chat --planner llm --auto-step --message "Please pick the red block and place it on the tray."
```

The chat command defaults to `--planner auto`: it uses the LLM planner when `.env` contains API settings and falls back to rule-based chat otherwise. The chat agent reads chat, memory, capabilities, world, and feedback from StateStore. It writes replies, current intent, and proposed actions back to StateStore. Watch still validates and executes those actions.

When a chat message looks like a code task, the same `physical-agent chat` entry automatically switches into the code skill. That means prompts such as "modify this file", "write tests", "fix this bug", or "help me integrate this SDK" can trigger repository edits, local test runs, and persistent lessons in `.physical-agent/code/LESSONS.md` without creating a separate command. The physical execution boundary does not change: only `watch` can touch hardware.

Repo-local skills are also discoverable from the `skills/` directory, and you can inspect them with `physical-agent skill list`. The built-in code skill is the first example of that pattern.

When chat prints `LLM chat was unavailable`, the framework did not crash. It means `--planner auto` tried the API first and then used the local rule-based fallback. Common causes:

- `HTTP 503`: the upstream provider is temporarily unavailable.
- `HTTP 429`: the provider is rate limiting the key or upstream model.
- `SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING`: the provider closed the TLS connection early, often due to gateway instability or an unsupported route/model.
- `model not found` or provider-specific errors: set `GPT_MODEL` to a model name your provider actually supports.

Use `physical-agent llm-test --model <model-name>` to verify a candidate model. If you want strict API behavior with no fallback, run chat with `--planner llm`; if you want the CLI to stay usable during API outages, keep the default `--planner auto`.

If you want chat to behave like a code-first assistant inside the current repository, ask it to edit files or fix tests directly. The chat runtime will route those requests into the code skill, apply changes under the repository root, run tests, and report the changed files plus test output.

By default, chat keeps code skill output conversational and stores the structured result in chat metadata. The Dashboard deliberately does not expose the repository-editing code skill; for debugging, add `--show-code-result` to the CLI to print the full structured result after the natural reply.

Execute the proposed actions by running watch in another terminal:

```bash
physical-agent watch
```

Or run one watch step in-process for a quick local check:

```bash
python -c "import asyncio; from physical_agent.watch.runtime import WatchRuntime; r=WatchRuntime('physical-agent.yaml'); asyncio.run(r.setup()); print('executed', asyncio.run(r.step(setup=False)))"
physical-agent inspect
```

You can also make LLM planning the project default by editing `physical-agent.yaml`:

```yaml
agent:
  planner: llm
  model: gpt-5.4
```

## Clean-Room Implementation

Physical Agent is an independent implementation. It uses general public architecture ideas such as embodied-agent layering, watchdog/runtime separation, declarative driver manifests, structured state stores, and MCP-style tool facades. It does not include third-party competitor code, copied file contents, copied README wording, copied CLI design, copied example task suites, or copied implementation details.

## Development Checks

Run the full test suite:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Current coverage includes SAFETY/LOG sidecar behavior, legacy workspace fail-closed detection and historical rescue, SQLite workspace lifecycle, driver manifest and loader behavior, hardware onboarding scaffold generation, safety validation, mock drivers, rule-based planning, watch runtime stepping, the end-to-end SQLite loop, one-command setup, doctor checks, and FastAPI/Dashboard contracts.

It also covers the chat protocol, chat memory, chat action proposals, chat auto-step execution, and the GUI chat endpoint.
